        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>It's old fashioned, it's comforting, it makes the kitchen smell wonderful and it's good for the soul.</p>
            <p>Instead of throwing out your orange peels, put them to good use in your crock pot! I love how this mixture of orange peels and spices fills my home with a warm, inviting aroma. Making your own potpourri can't get any easier than this! Even better--it's non-toxic!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3  oranges, peels of </li>
                <li>6 cloves, whole </li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground (or 1/2 cinnamon stick) </li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ginger, ground (or 1/2-inch nub, grated) </li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, ground (or freshly ground) </li>
                <li>1 cup water </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Into a small crock pot, place orange peels, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.</li>
                <li>Pour water over all.</li>
                <li>Set on low heat for the entire day, checking the water level periodically to prevent burning.</li>
                <li>You can even enjoy it for one more day if you like. Just place the cooled mixture into a container, refrigerate and reheat another day (which is what I do often).</li>
            </ol>
